 *Polumorphism:-
 *	Polymorphism in java, is an object's ability to take on various forms.
 *  It enables us to complete one action in many different ways
 *	Allows you to have many forms with same purpose.
 *
 *  Types of Polimorphism :-
 * 	 	1.Compile Time Polimorphism (method overloading)
 *  	2.Run Time Polymorphism (method overriding)
 *  
 *Method Overriding:-
 *	Process of implementing parent class method in subclass is called method overriding.
 *	Creating new body for the inherited functions.
 *	Changing implementation as per requirement.
 *	Inheritance is must.
 *	Method signature must be same.
 *
 *Method Overloading:-
 *	is a feature that  enables class have multiple methods with the same name,
 *  different parameters and different return types.
 *  
 * 	Private methods can be overloaded.
 * 	Can't have same name,same parameters but different return type.
 *	
 *
 *	Private methods can't be overridden :-
 *			because when superclass method is private it will not be visible to subclass.
 * 			Whatever the methods you write in subclass will be treated as new method and
 * 			not an overridden method.
