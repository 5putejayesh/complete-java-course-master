 *Anonymous Class:-
 *	Local defination of a class.
 *	Has no name.
 *	Can be instantiated only once.
 *	Usually declared inside a method or code block ,the curly braces ending with semicolon.
 *	Is accessible only at the point where it is defined.
 *	Doesn't have a constructor simply because it doesn't have name.
 *	Can't be static.
 *	usually extend subclasses or implement interfaces.
 *
 *Usage Of Inner Classes:-
 *	Good option if you need a class that will be used only in the outer class.
 *	Static nested classes are the most useful.
 *	Can increase encapsulation-TRUE but makes your code less readable.
